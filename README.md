# medhelp

The wastage of medicine which can be used to save a poor man's life is a great tragedy. We are creating a web application which will have a database of unused and unexpired medicines which can redistributed through different methods. We will also host a list of contributors ranked according to their contribution to gamify the process. We will encourage and convience the users to contribute not just unused medicines but also donate as much as they can to the needy. They will also be encouraged to work as volunteers whenever needed.
